# Snowflake SQL Practice

This repository contains my practice with **Snowflake SQL** commands, covering both basic and advanced features such as file formats, staging, copying data from external sources, JSON parsing, warehouses, and role-based access.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

### 1. `fileformat.sql`
Covers working with **JSON data** in Snowflake:
- Creating an external stage pointing to an S3 bucket.
- Defining a JSON file format.
- Creating a database (`JSON_DB`) and table (`JSON_RAW`) with `VARIANT` type.
- Copying JSON data into Snowflake from external stage.
- Querying JSON data using:
  - Dot and colon notation (`RAW_FILE:city`, `$1:first_name`).
  - Type casting (`::string`, `::int`).
- Extracting nested JSON fields (`RAW_FILE:job.salary`, `RAW_FILE:prev_company[0]`).
- Flattening arrays (e.g., `spoken_languages`) into rows with `table(flatten(...))`.

---

### 2. `stage&copy.sql`
Covers **staging and copying CSV data** in Snowflake:
- Creating a database and schema for external stages.
- Creating a stage (`AWS_STAGE`) pointing to an S3 bucket.
- Describing and listing files in the stage.
- Creating tables for storing order details (`orders`, `ordersx`, `orderspro`).
- Copying data from stage to Snowflake tables using `COPY INTO`.
- Selecting specific columns from staged files (`s.$1`, `s.$5`).
- Using transformations while copying:
  - Adding a **calculated profitability column** with `CASE WHEN` logic.

---

### 3. `create-wh-roles-grants.sql`
Covers **warehouses, roles, users, and grants** in Snowflake:
- Creating warehouses (`DS_WH`, `DBA_WH`) with auto-suspend, auto-resume, and scaling policies.
- Creating roles (`DATA_SCIENTIST`, `DBA`) and granting warehouse usage.
- Creating users (`DS1`, `DS2`, `DS3`, `DBA1`, `DBA2`) with default roles and warehouses.
- Assigning roles to users.
- Dropping users, roles, and warehouses to clean up.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Concepts Practiced
- **Stages**: External stages referencing AWS S3.
- **File Formats**: JSON and CSV parsing.
- **Copy Command**: Loading structured/unstructured data into Snowflake.
- **VARIANT Type**: Storing semi-structured data.
- **Flatten Function**: Handling arrays within JSON.
- **Transformations on Load**: Conditional logic inside `COPY INTO`.
- **Warehouses**: Creating, scaling, and configuring warehouses.
- **Roles & Grants**: Managing access control via RBAC.
- **User Management**: Creating, assigning, and dropping users.
